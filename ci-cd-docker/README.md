# CI/CD for Docker
In this lab we will create an entire environment of developement.
We will create a basic ci/cd for docker that will build the image and push it to your docker hub account.

## Requirements
This lab assumes that you are running on a linux machine (MACOS is also good).
Please install theese softwares on your machine/workstation:
* docker 
* docker-compose

## Environment
This is your working directory for this lab (Labs/ci-cd-docker).

## GitHub
Please create a GitHub account at: https://github.com/
Fork this repository to your account.
Please clone another repository ftom this project:  
    `git clone https://github.com/devops-culture-project/nodejs-app-docker.git`

## Docker Hub
Please create a docker hub account at: https://hub.docker.com/

## Jenkins
Attached there is a Dockerfile. It will be your jenkins (also docker installed inside)
Run this command:  
    `docker build . -t devops-culture/jenkins-docker:1`  

Ensure that the docker image created:  
    `docker image ls`  

In your machine - please create the following directory:  
    `mkdir /var/jenkins_home`

Attached there is a docker-compose.yml file. It will set up your Jenkins server.  
On your own:
* Look at the compose file and see whats inside.
* Find the address that jenkins will listen to.  

run in the working directory:  
    `docker-compose up -d`  
View the generated administrator password to log in the first time:  
    `docker exec jenkins-docker cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`  
Enter jenkins and log in.

![Jenkins First Login](pictures/jenkins-first-login.png)

Enter the password and continue.  
In next screen, click “Install suggested plugins” and wait for them to install.  
In the next section you need to create a user for yourself.

![Jenkins first user admin](pictures/create-first-user-admin.png)

Click "get start using Jenkins"  
Now we need to install two plugins:
* blueocean plugin to beautify your jenkins. This plugin better the usability of jenkins and focus in pipelines scripts.
* locale plugin to jenkins always show english text. You don’t need install this, but i suggest install to search errors directly in english.

Go to Plugin Manager again and search for locale.

To install plugins:
- In home of jenkins, click in Manage Jenkins:

![Jenkins Menu](pictures/jenkins-menu.png)

- Click manage plugins:

![Jenkins Menu Manage Plugins](pictures/jenkins-manage-plugins.png)

In Plugin manager, you need click in Available tab and after load the tab, search the plugins:

![Jenkins Plugin Manager](pictures/plugin-manager.png)

Search for locale, mark the checkbox and click in install button:

![Locale Installation](pictures/locale-install.png)

After install locale, go to Home > Manage Jenkins > Configure System.

![Configure System](pictures/jenkins-configure-system.png)

Search for locale. Input “en” in “Default language” and check “ignore browser preference and force this language to all users”:

![Choose Locale Language](pictures/locale-lang.png)

Locale Plugin installed and configured, lets install Blue ocean.
Back to jenkins home > Manage jenkins >Manage Plugins. In Available tab search for blueocean and install it.

![Blue Ocean Installation](pictures/blueocean-install.png)

All done. But you see the visual without blue ocean plugin, let’s use it.
In Jenkins home, Click in “Open Blue Ocean” (left menu):

![Choose Blue Ocean](pictures/jenkins-menu-blueocean.png)

Now, you will see a screen like this:

![Blue Ocean View](pictures/blue-ocean-jenkins-view.png)

All Right, now we have jenkins installed and we are using blue ocean plugin to have a better experience in your pipelines.

The next steps is create a pipeline to build some things for us.

## Jenkinsfile
Attached is a Jenkinsfile for this lab.

### Explenation
In this pipeline, We have 2 environment variables to change the registry and the credential easily.
The job will have one step.Docker build command will be run by utilizing the jenkins build number in the docker tag.

## Creating a job to test docker command
Click on "Create new pipeline"
Fill the form:
* Choose GitHub
* Give an access token which you can create via the "create access token" link
* Choose user user
* Choose the devops culture repository
Click "Create pipeline"

![Choose GitHub](pictures/create-pipeline.png)

In the next view we\ll build the pipeline

![Pipeline Creation](pipeline-workflow-creation.png)

Click on '+' and call this job "build nodejs-app image"
Add a step from kind "Run arbitrary Pipeline script"

Copy the Jenkinsfile code to the job window:

![Pipeline Inside a job](pictures/add-pipeline-code.png)

Save the job and commit to master.

## Testing docker command in the job
Click on “Build Now” in job’s menu:

![Choose Build Now](pictures/jenkins-menu-build-now.png)

It will ask you to generate a token. Press on the link "create an access token here".  
Create an access token and then copy the token back to jenkins.  
Choose your user (It suppose to be the only user) and then the lab's repository, and "Create Pipeline".
